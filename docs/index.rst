The ``MCSimPython`` package is developed as a part of the master thesis of M. Kongshaug, H. Mo, and J. Hygen, at the
`Department of Marine Technology (NTNU, Trondheim) <https://www.ntnu.edu/imt>`_. The package is used for simulation of DP stationkeeping models and
manuevering models subject to first- and second order wave loads.
